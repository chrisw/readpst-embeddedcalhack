Need testing on big-endian machines. We may be missing some LEnn_CPU()
calls.

pst2diii needs header and mime type updates from readpst.

At the next soname bump (to libpst.so.3) we should
    remove contact->access_method (or find the proper mapi element id for it)
    remove pst_x_attrib_ll->type (unused)
    reorder appointment fields to collect related fields
    remove readpstlog, and produce directly ascii debug log files
    change pst_attach_to_mem to return pst_binary
