.SH NAME
readpst \- convert PST (MS Outlook Personal Folders) files to mbox format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B readpst
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B readpst
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBreadpst\fP is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders) file
and convert it into an mbox file, a format suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox
structure, or seperate emails.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-c
Set the Contact output mode. Use -cv for vcard format or -cl for
an email list
.TP
.B \-d
Specify name of debug log file. Defaults to "readpst.log". The log
file isn\'t an ascii file, it is a binary file readable by \fBreadpstlog\fP.
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options. Subsequent options are then ignored.
.TP
.B \-k
Changes the output format to KMail.
.TP
.B \-o
Specifies the output directory. The directory must already exist, and
is entered after the PST file is opened, but before any processing of
files commences.
.TP
.B \-q
Changes to silent mode. No feedback is printed to the screen, except
for error messages.
.TP
.B \-r
Changes the output format to Recursive. This will create folders as
named in the PST file, and will put all emails in a file called "mbox"
inside each folder. These files are then compatible with all
mbox\-compatible email clients.
.TP
.B \-S
Output messages into seperate files. This will create folders as
named in the PST file, and will put each email in its own file. These
files will be numbered from 000000000 increasing in intervals of 1 (ie
000000000, 000000001, 0000000002). Any attachments are saved alongside
each email as 000000000\-attach0, or with the name of the attachment if
one is present.
.TP
.B \-V
Show version of program. Subsequent options are then ignored.
.TP
.B \-w
Overwrite any previous output files. \fBBeware\fP: When used with the \-S
switch, this will remove all files from the target folder before
writing. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments correct.
