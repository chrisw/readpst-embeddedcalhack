.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This manual page briefly documents the \fBreadpst\fR command\&.

.PP
 \fBreadpst\fR is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders) file and convert it into an mbox file, a format suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox structure, or separate emails\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-c \fIformat\fR
Set the Contact output mode\&. Use \-cv for vcard format or \-cl for an email list\&.

.TP
\-d \fIdebug\-file\fR
Specify name of debug log file\&. Defaults to "readpst\&.log"\&. The log file isn't an ascii file, it is a binary file readable by \fBreadpstlog\fR\&.

.TP
\-h
Show summary of options\&.

.TP
\-k
Changes the output format to KMail\&.

.TP
\-o \fIoutput\-directory\fR
Specifies the output directory\&. The directory must already exist, and is entered after the PST file is opened, but before any processing of files commences\&.

.TP
\-q
Changes to silent mode\&. No feedback is printed to the screen, except for error messages\&.

.TP
\-r
Changes the output format to Recursive\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put all emails in a file called "mbox" inside each folder\&. These files are then compatible with all mbox\-compatible email clients\&.

.TP
\-S
Output messages into seperate files\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email in its own file\&. These files will be numbered from 000000000 increasing in intervals of 1 (ie 000000000, 000000001, 0000000002)\&. Any attachments are saved alongside each email as 000000000\-attach0, or with the name of the attachment if one is present\&.

.TP
\-V
Show version of program\&. Subsequent options are then ignored\&.

.TP
\-w
Overwrite any previous output files\&. Beware: When used with the \-S switch, this will remove all files from the target folder before writing\&. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments correct\&.
