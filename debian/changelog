libpst (0.6.27-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  [ HggdH ]
  * new upstream source being used  (LP: #317602) -- www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst:
    Debian's libpst version does not provide a shared library, and
    does not support newer Evolution PST files; dropping it.
  * remove upstream basic debianisation, and re-debianise using CDBS.
    upstream provides a basic, incomplete, and non-functional ./debian;
    also, add a ./debian/rules get-orig-source target in order to 
    cleanup nicely.
  * debian/patches/10-current-attach.patch: patch for Evolution use,
      should be eventually dropped for a Evolution patch upstream.
  * debian/patches/05-disable-debian-gen.patch: adjust configure.in
    and Makefile.am not to generate the debian directory and files.
  * changed dependency from libgd2-noxpm to libgd2-xpm >= 2.0.36
      (current jaunty alpha 3 level).
  * add a Conflitcs for readpst < 0.6.27, to guarantee upgrade for
    those using the old libpst packages.

  * Set priority: extra and remove conflicts on same binary package
  * debian/copyright: Update and mention GPL-2+ licensed file src/lzfu.c
